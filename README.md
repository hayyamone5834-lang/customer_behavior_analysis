# customer_behavior_analysis
Data analytics project showcasing customer behavior analysis using Python, SQL, Power BI 

# Overview

This project demonstrates a full end-to-end data analytics workflow, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying, dashboard creation, and reporting.
The goal is to analyze the dataset, uncover insights, and present them in a clear and engaging format using Power BI and a final presentation built with Gamma.

# Dataset

Source: GitHub
Format: CSV 
Description: This dataset contains 3,900 rows and 18 columns detailing consumer demographics, product preferences, and transactional behaviors to provide insights into retail shopping trends.
Key Attributes: Key fields in this dataset include Customer ID, Age, and Gender for demographics, Item Purchased and Category for product tracking, and financial metrics such as Purchase Amount (USD) and Discount Applied.

# Tools & Technologies

Python (Jupyter Notebook) – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA
Pandas – Data manipulation
SQLAlchemy / create_engine – Connecting Python to PostgreSQL/SQL Server
PostgreSQL / SQL Server – Data querying and analysis
Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation
Gamma – Project presentation

# Project Steps

1. Data Loading

- Imported the raw dataset into Python using Jupyter Notebook
- Inspected structure, checked data types, and validated schema

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Summary statistics
- Distribution analysis
- Correlation checks
- Initial visualizations to understand patterns

3. Data Cleaning

- Handled missing values
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized formats (dates, categories, etc.)
- Created new derived fields where needed

4. SQL Analysis

- Exported or connected cleaned data to PostgreSQL/SQL Server
- Executed SQL queries to validate findings
- Performed aggregations, joins, and filtering for deeper insights

5. Power BI Dashboard

- Imported cleaned dataset
- Built interactive visuals (KPIs, charts, slicers)
- Highlighted key business insights and trends

6. Presentation (Gamma)

- Created a clean and engaging slideshow
- Summarized the process, insights, and dashboard walkthrough
